<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



This website is designed to expand the research and topic of planetary protection. The main focus is the concern around the recent increase in commcercial spaceflight around the world. We aim to look at what the future of planetary protection should look like in regard to both legal and scientific practices.

The website it divided into multiple sections:
* What is Planetary Protection?
* Previous Protection Efforts
* Should We Be Concerned?
* The Future of Planetary Protection

Each webpage has interactive elements which include games and simulations in order to bring an element of entertainment to learning. The goal of this project is to design a fun and interactive model of conveying research, similar to what one might find in a museum.
